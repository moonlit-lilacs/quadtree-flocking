Inspired by a Coding Train video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhjuuHl6qHM) in which he implemented flocking in JS. This is implemented in C++ with quadtree optimization to allow for efficient local lookups, speeding up the computation for each boid massively. The simulation can handle ~500 boids on my machine without dipping below 70fps and can handle ~1,000 at 30fps after the first chaotic seconds.
